     * The camera contains two important properties:
     * - view transform matrix: Contains information about location and orientation of the camera. This matrix will
     * transform geometry from world space to eye space.
     * - projection transform matrix: Contains information about the projection the camera uses (roughly equivalent to
     * which lens it uses). Generally this can either be perspective projection (with a field of view) or a orthographic
     * projection (without any perspective).
     *
     * The camera also includes information about the viewport, which defines which part of the window is used for
     * rendering (default settings is the full window)
     *
     * The default camera is positioned at (0,0,0) and looking down the negative z-axis. Everything inside the volume
     * between -1 to 1 is viewed.
